# HebLibre Workflow State

## Purpose
This file is the canonical handoff state for the HebLibre project.
GitHub is the source of truth. Chat history, agent memory, and local workspace state are non-authoritative.

## Current repository state
- Repository: `brasilia736211600-netizen/HebLibre`
- Active development branch: `genspark-dev`
- Current HEAD: `9aca596d6361104d7982563c3784512caab98cfa`
- Default branch: `l10n_crowdin`
- Project type: Android application based on the FOSS Browser/WebView codebase

## Verification ladder
Never mark a capability as complete merely because code exists.
- SOURCE-VERIFIED: implementation exists and source inspection supports the claim.
- TEST-VERIFIED: automated tests pass for the relevant contract.
- CI-VERIFIED: GitHub Actions passes for the exact commit.
- ANDROID-RUNTIME-VERIFIED: verified on an Android device/emulator.
- DOCUMENTED: recorded here and/or in the project map.

The strongest applicable status must always be stated explicitly.

## Completed baseline
### Build/toolchain recovery
- Portable Eclipse Temurin JDK 11 was used for the legacy Gradle 5.4.1 toolchain.
- Minimal Android SDK components were installed for compile SDK 29 / build-tools 28.0.3.
- `compileOptions` was restored to Java 8 compatibility.
- 19 `Objects.requireNonNull(findPreference(...))` sites were fixed with explicit `androidx.preference.Preference` typing because JDK 11 + source 8 exposed generic inference failures.
- Local debug APK build succeeded.
- Baseline build commit: `e11562fd42639d5b12e5468c14d461523aa96529`.

Status: BUILD-VERIFIED / not Android-runtime verified.

### Minimal TDD harness
- Added JUnit 4.12 test dependency.
- Added `BrowserUnitTest` with four deterministic `BrowserUnit.isURL` tests.
- `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` passed locally.
- Test harness commit: `6211fc57cc5589f24106df0c1aa2a4e7b6ae2058`.

Status: TEST-VERIFIED.

### CI
- GitHub Actions workflow uses JDK 17 for Android SDK setup and JDK 11 for the legacy Gradle build/test toolchain.
- Successful CI head: `9aca596d6361104d7982563c3784512caab98cfa`.
- Successful workflow run: `33459477325`.

Status: CI-VERIFIED for `9aca596d6361104d7982563c3784512caab98cfa`.

### Runtime
- No Android device/emulator runtime verification has been completed yet.

Status: NOT VERIFIED.

## Product-development state
Product feature implementation has not yet started on this branch after the baseline/CI recovery.

### Current phase
`P0 — Profile / Identity Isolation — TDD Discovery`

### Exact current objective
Determine the smallest viable profile/identity isolation boundary using the existing architecture, before implementing feature code.

### Required investigation
1. WebView lifecycle.
2. Cookie/storage/database handling.
3. Settings/preferences that influence browser state.
4. Tab/session lifecycle.
5. Global versus per-WebView/per-tab state.
6. Smallest existing isolation seam.

### TDD requirement
Before production changes, define the smallest meaningful pure-Java/business-logic test contract that can be exercised without an emulator. Add Robolectric only if source inspection proves it is necessary.

### Explicit YAGNI boundary
Do not implement the following during P0 discovery:
- User-Agent spoofing
- Proxy support
- WebRTC leak controls
- Canvas fingerprint changes
- WebGL fingerprint changes
- Audio fingerprint changes
- Timezone spoofing
- Locale spoofing
- Other fingerprinting work

Do not add a new architecture unless the existing architecture is demonstrably insufficient.

## Work-allocation policy
Use the two-agent setup intentionally:

### Genspark should consume credits on
- Deep repository archaeology and cross-file architectural tracing.
- Long implementation tasks with many dependent edits.
- Complex debugging where iterative reasoning is required.
- Running the full local/CI test loop after substantive changes.
- Multi-file feature implementation and refactoring.
- Producing a complete evidence-backed implementation report.

### ChatGPT / low-cost orchestration should handle
- Reading and verifying GitHub state.
- Comparing commits, branches, CI state, and diffs.
- Small documentation/state updates.
- Small, deterministic repository edits when no long reasoning loop is needed.
- Detecting whether a task is already complete.
- Preparing precise bounded prompts for Genspark.
- Reviewing Genspark output against the verification ladder and YAGNI.

### Parallelism rule
Do not leave Genspark waiting on work that can be done independently. While Genspark performs a long implementation/test cycle, perform independent GitHub/state/documentation verification here when safe. Do not create conflicting edits on the same files/branch concurrently.

## Execution protocol for every substantive step
`READ → VERIFY → RECONCILE → PLAN → EXECUTE → TEST → DIFF → COMMIT → SAVE STATE`

A step is not considered closed until:
- the actual repository state is checked,
- the implementation/test evidence is recorded,
- the resulting commit SHA is known,
- CI status is checked when applicable,
- the state file is updated,
- and the next single execution step is written down.

## Current single next execution step
Run the P0 TDD discovery prompt against commit `9aca596d6361104d7982563c3784512caab98cfa`.
Do not implement the feature until the discovery report identifies the isolation boundary and exact test contract.
